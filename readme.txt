To use scripts in After Effects, you can follow these detailed steps:

Find and install scripts: Find the script you want to use. Scripts for After Effects typically come in the form of .jsx or .jsxbin files. You can find scripts from various sources, including third-party websites or the official Adobe After Effects website. Download the script file and place it in the appropriate location.

For Windows: 
Copy the script file to the "Scripts" folder located in the After Effects installation directory. 
The default path is usually "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects [version]\Support Files\Scripts".


For macOS: Copy the script file to the "Scripts" folder located in the After Effects application folder. 
The default path is usually "/Applications/Adobe After Effects [version]/Scripts".
Run a script: After installing the script, open After Effects and open the composition you want to work with.


Go to "File" > "Scripts".
In the "Scripts" sub-menu, you'll see a list of available scripts. The recently installed script should appear in the list.
Click on the script name to run it.
