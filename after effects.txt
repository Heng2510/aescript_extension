Managing File and File Organization ( videos , pictures , layers , composition ,,,,, ) 

Composition (1920x1080 16:9 1080x1080 1:1)... need to learn it by heart cus it is important

Using Scripts with .jsx File Extension, Installing Script Software via Adobe Extension (For example, a script for pre-composition is a piece of code written in the JavaScript programming

 language, serving as a plugin for shortcut extension in AE, providing utility and time-saving features. Some examples include creating null objects, creating keyframes, creating layers, etc...... 
              

           code (.jsx) optional to understand haha :)))
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Create a Precomposition Script for After Effects

// Prompt for the precomposition name
var precompName = prompt("Enter the name of the precomposition:", "");

// Check if a name was entered
if (precompName !== null && precompName !== "") {
  // Get the selected layers in the active composition
  var selectedLayers = app.project.activeItem.selectedLayers;
  
  // Check if any layers are selected
  if (selectedLayers.length > 0) {
    // Create a new precomposition
    var precomp = app.project.activeItem.layers.precompose(selectedLayers, precompName, true);
    
    // Display a success message
    alert("Precomposition created successfully with the name: " + precomp.name);
  } else {
    // No layers selected, display an error message
    alert("Please select at least one layer to create a precomposition.");
  }
} else {
  // No name entered, display an error message
  alert("Please enter a valid name for the precomposition.");
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To use this script in After Effects, follow these steps:

1 Open After Effects and create a new composition or open an existing one.
2 Go to "File" > "Scripts" > "New Script File" to open the scripting editor.
3 Copy and paste the above script into the scripting editor.
4 Save the script with a .jsx or .js file extension (e.g., "PrecompositionScript.jsx").
5 Go back to After Effects and select the layers you want to precompose.
6 Go to "File" > "Scripts" > "Run Script File" and select the script file you saved.
7 A prompt will appear asking for the precomposition name. Enter a name and click "OK."
8 If the precomposition is created successfully, a success message will appear.
MUST RESTART YOUR APPLICATION BEFORE USING IT

For example about the basic plugin that people always use for simple edit is TWIXTOR : description about it 

IMAGINE THAT : It works by analyzing the motion within a sequence of frames and intelligently interpolating new frames to create the illusion of slow motion or time manipulation.

Apply Twixtor to a layer in After Effects, you can adjust its parameters to control the speed and quality of the slow-motion effect. Here's a simplified explanation of how Twixtor works in a layer:

Frame Analysis: Twixtor analyzes the motion between frames in your footage. It identifies moving objects and tracks their movement across frames.

Frame Interpolation: Based on the motion analysis, Twixtor intelligently generates new frames between the existing frames. These interpolated frames help create smooth and fluid motion.

Time Remapping: Twixtor allows you to manipulate the timing of your footage. By adjusting keyframes or using speed ramps, you can speed up or slow down specific sections of your footage.

Speed Controls: Twixtor provides various parameters to control the speed and quality of the slow-motion effect. You can adjust the Speed parameter to determine how much to slow down the footage. The Frame Rate parameter allows you to specify the output frame rate of the slow-motion sequence.

Quality Settings: Twixtor offers different quality modes to enhance the interpolation process. You can choose between options like Draft, Normal, and High Quality, depending on your project requirements and the level of detail in your footage.

Masking and Tracking: If needed, Twixtor allows you to apply masks to limit the effect to specific areas of the frame. You can also use tracking tools to automatically track the movement of objects and apply the effect accurately. 

By using Twixtor, you can achieve smooth slow-motion effects even with footage that was not originally captured at a high frame rate. It helps create realistic and visually appealing slow-motion sequences by intelligently generating new frames.

TWIXTOR + 60fps = smooth
TWIXTOR +60fps - dead frame = smoother
-dead frame + FLOWFRAMES + 60fps + TWIXTOR = SMOOTHIEST

               why ?


FLOWFRAMES ????? whats that 

https://nmkd.itch.io/flowframes


what can it do ?????? actually ,                                         depends on fpssss 

When people use the technique of "flow frames," they are essentially increasing the frame rate of a video or animation to create smoother motion. By inserting additional frames between the original frames, the motion appears more fluid and continuous, reducing the perception of choppiness or jerkiness.

The standard frame rate for videos is typically 24 frames per second (fps) or 30 fps. When an action or movement occurs within these frame rates, there can be noticeable gaps between frames, especially during fast-paced or complex motions. This can result in a less smooth and more stuttered visual experience.

By adding flow frames, the frame rate is increased, meaning more frames are inserted between the original frames. For example, if the original video is captured at 24 fps, flow frames may be added to increase the effective frame rate to 48 fps or higher. These additional frames fill in the gaps between the original frames, creating smoother transitions and reducing the perception of motion blur.

The interpolation process used to generate flow frames involves analyzing the movement in the original frames and creating new frames that interpolate the motion between them. This interpolation can be done using various algorithms, such as optical flow, which estimate the movement of pixels between frames.

The result is a video or animation with smoother and more natural-looking motion. This can be particularly beneficial for fast-moving subjects, dynamic camera movements, or any action that requires precise and fluid motion. By increasing the frame rate through flow frames, the viewer experiences a more immersive and visually pleasing viewing experience.

It's important to note that while flow frames can enhance the smoothness of motion, they do not add actual detail or information that was not present in the original frames. They simply create the illusion of smoother motion by inserting additional frames based on the analysis of the existing frames.

THAT IS DESCRIPTION.

In particular, there are some excellent extension plugins available that greatly facilitate project workflow and time-saving tasks. For example, Mister Horse is a popular plugin used for creating Evo Texts. You can find tutorials on how to make Evo Texts and how to use Mister Horse in After Effects.             YOUTUBE 

Simple video editing can be done using the built-in effects and tools in After Effects, such as text animation, shape animation, and logo animation. It is recommended to search for tutorials and gain an understanding of these techniques.

Some commonly used layers in After Effects include Adjustment layer, Null layer, Solid layer, Camera layer, Text layer, Shape layer, Video layer, and PNG layer. It's important to learn about each of these layers and their functionalities.

For basic animation, you can explore properties like Scale (2D and 3D zoom) 3D zoom depends on camera motion, Position (moving layers and creating motion effects with keyframes, as well as understanding Anchor Point and Parenting concepts), Rotation, Graph Editor, and Timeline (adjusting and manipulating keyframes, viewing graphs, and getting familiar with concepts like ease in/out and bezier handles). Experimenting with these settings will help you achieve smooth animations.

Different image file formats like PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, and PSD have varying characteristics and purposes. Understanding the differences will help you choose the appropriate format for your needs.

The bit depth of a video/image affects its color representation and can impact the quality of gradients and fine details. Higher bit depths generally provide better color accuracy and smoother transitions (maybe )?

3D camera tracking involves analyzing footage to recreate a virtual camera within After Effects. It allows you to composite 3D elements into your scene. On the other hand, 2D camera tracking is used to track the movement of a 2D layer within a 2D space.

Keyframes and interpolation are essential for creating motion effects. Dead frames refer to still frames inserted intentionally for specific effects. For example, in anime research, you can use down frames to analyze animation sequences.

To download anime episodes without subtitles, you can use websites like jut.su and nyasi for torrent downloads, or mega.nz for file hosting. Please note that I cannot provide direct links.

Using tools like "Paint" and "Puppet" allows for virtual manipulation and distortion effects. It is worth exploring these techniques beforehand ( cool stuff )
